What is a programming language?</h2>\n<p>Some people have asked me if they should change their carrer path to programming. What are the things to take into consideration? Today the same question was asked again, and I seemed to have an answer I believe I should share.</p>\n<p><strong>For me programming is learining the language of the computer.</strong> I cannot say this summarizes it, but it tells a lot if you give it some thinking. Today we are surrounded with computers. Everyone seems to have atleast one computer. There are probably more computers than humans. Some people may want to question this. In childhood, I used to define computer as <em>a device that takes input, processes it, and produces output.</em> So for my understanding, many things we use in this digital age is a computer. For example our phones, smart tv, tablets, health bands, etc.</p>\n<p>Today we carry around devices that are extremely powerful, but many aren't fluent in the language that these devices understand. Yes computer and programming basics are now a part of curriculum in every field. But people forget and that is good actually. A manager doesn't need to know how the office application package works or what their smart phones are actually capable of doing.</p>\n<p>Learning a programming language is one thing, and taking on programming as a career is a whole different domain. Learning a programming language is the same as learning any other language. It will expand your potential. It gives you an oppertunity to exercise your mind. After learning any language, you can now go further interacting with others who know the same language. Maybe read some literature or something else prepared with this language. That definately doesn't mean this new language will, or should have any drastic impact on your life. However if you start living on the society that uses this language, this knowledge will be a great tool you will use every moment. That is where programming as a career comes in. When you make programming a profession or intend to, you are contracting to join this new society with an added vocabulary. Even if you didn't know their language, you start understanding the bits and pieces of it gradually. This is something anyone can do. If you want to experience a glimpse of the fun in the programming world, I would suggest <a href=\"https://hourofcode.com/\" title=\"Hour of code\">Hour of CODE</a>. Do check it out if you have not yet.</p>\n<h2>What programming language should you learn then?</h2>\n<p>Today, there are many programming languages to choose from. Its almost like chooosing a color for your new room. You should know that the same basic color green has many varients or shades when you are asked to choose. Definately you can't put all the varients in your walls. Similarly if you want to be a programmer you don't need to know many programming languages. You can choose any trending programming language.</p>\n<p>Currently some trending languages are javascript, python, go, java, .Net and R. I mostly recomment python or java for beginners. In case you plan to program the web, you need to start with html, css, and javascript. Which ever programming language you learn, the basics concepts are the same. Actually a programming language does not solve any problem. The algorithms and problem solving skills put in a program determines the quality of the program. The same algorithm and skills can produce the same program in different languages, and the performance will vary very little. In the end all it matters is if you solve the problem or not.</p>\n<h2>Start programming!</h2>\n<p>Galileo Galilei once said, \"We cannot teach people anything. We can only help them discover it within themselves.” In case of programming, every one from birth has curosity and logical reasoning for solving problems. Hence everyone has the ability to be a programmer. If you have an intrest to be a problem solver, start now. Find someone who can help you start. Find cources online, or join a hackathon. There are hundreds of ways to start. Just be smart with your decisions and make it quick.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Start Programming",date:"December 16, 2017",path:"/start-programming",tags:["programmer","programming","why","start","coding"],excerpt:'Galileo Galilei once said, "We cannot teach people anything.

The more I do, the more I seem to get better at it. Along the way, I find many more experienced players on the way.</p>\n<p>I started a career in programming as a Software <a href="">RnD</a> in <a href="http://rts.com.np" title="Real Time Solutions">RTS</a>. My college mates Ruraj, Sagun and Sushan pulled me there as they planned to go abroad for further studies. There I started learning core java, and then spring framework. For the front end I knew plain html and js, which gradually changed upgraded angular. Mysql databases were used which changed to postgres. PHP full stack applications turned to java sping-boot. And later, I found simplicity in writing everything in JS, the same v8 engine in mongo shell, node, and browsers made sence for web apps.</p>\n<p>My source of learning used to be pluralsight, and books. Now I learn from youtube and egghead, books from succinity and safari, and articles that I find on the internet. I think JS is a language that is simple enough to be taught to kids replacing the old Q-BASIC that is still taught to kids. although current OS can barely fins emulators to run the code. Familiarity with Python and JS should be known by everyone so that they understand the real meaning of computers and computing.</p>\n<p>I know the pain of debugging applications written on custom frameworks and programming languages I don\'t even understand like PHP. hence I have a gret respect for programming patterns. Talking of which JS doesn\'t seem to have such a follow-up with programming design patterns. Lets not include everyone but I atleast have not seen many developers woth experience following standard programming patterns with JS. i too am a learner in this aspect.</p>\n<p>In terms of frameworks, the trends keep changing, and I believe vanilla JS is going to be the basic thing one should know more about than the different web frameworks. The language is promising to be more expressive than ever, and easy to reason. I have planned my next research on Cycle JS soon. React has made a great impression on me. It has helped me make better logical decisions rather than following old MVC and MVVM patters, separating the view completely.</p>\n<p>Currently I\'m working as a React developer with my friends at <a href="https://www.bitsbeat.com/" title="Bits beat IT Solution">Bits Beat</a>. We have a healthy team, and we take on challenges in the programming world with JS as our main tool.</p>',id:"/home/sailesh/workspace/crud-react-redux-mongo/my-blog/src/pages/2017-12-10-hello-world/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{date:"2017-12-10T21:07:59.165Z",path:"/hello-world",title:"Hello JS World",excerpt:"This blog begins with a hello world like any other programming book :)",tags:["first post","js","hello world","welcome"]}},next:null}}}});
