Today we are surrounded with computers. Everyone seems to have atleast one computer. There are probably more computers than humans. Some people may want to question this.

Learning a programming language is the same as learning any other language. It will expand your potential. It gives you an oppertunity to exercise your mind. After learning any language, you can now go further interacting with others who know the same language. Maybe read some literature or something else prepared with this language. That definately doesn't mean this new language will, or should have any drastic impact on your life. However if you start living on the society that uses this language, this knowledge will be a great tool you will use every moment. That is where programming as a career comes in. When you make programming a profession or intend to, you are contracting to join this new society with an added vocabulary. Even if you didn't know their language, you start understanding the bits and pieces of it gradually. This is something anyone can do.

Actually a programming language does not solve any problem. The algorithms and problem solving skills put in a program determines the quality of the program.
