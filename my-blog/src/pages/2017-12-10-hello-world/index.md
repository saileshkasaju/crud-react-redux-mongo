## Hello World

This blog begins with a hello world like any other programming book :)
For me programming has been like a challenging game like chess. The more I do, the more I seem to get better at it. Along the way, I find many more experienced players on the way.

I started a career in programming as a Software [RnD][software department researcher] in [RTS](http://rts.com.np "Real Time Solutions"). My college mates Ruraj, Sagun and Sushan pulled me there as they planned to go abroad for further studies. There I started learning core java, and then spring framework. For the front end I knew plain html and js, which gradually changed upgraded angular. Mysql databases were used which changed to postgres. PHP full stack applications turned to java sping-boot. And later, I found simplicity in writing everything in JS, the same v8 engine in mongo shell, node, and browsers made sence for web apps.

My source of learning used to be pluralsight, and books. Now I learn from youtube and egghead, books from succinity and safari, and articles that I find on the internet. I think JS is a language that is simple enough to be taught to kids replacing the old Q-BASIC that is still taught to kids. although current OS can barely fins emulators to run the code. Familiarity with Python and JS should be known by everyone so that they understand the real meaning of computers and computing.

I know the pain of debugging applications written on custom frameworks and programming languages I don't even understand like PHP. hence I have a gret respect for programming patterns. Talking of which JS doesn't seem to have such a follow-up with programming design patterns. Lets not include everyone but I atleast have not seen many developers woth experience following standard programming patterns with JS. i too am a learner in this aspect.

In terms of frameworks, the trends keep changing, and I believe vanilla JS is going to be the basic thing one should know more about than the different web frameworks. The language is promising to be more expressive than ever, and easy to reason. I have planned my next research on Cycle JS soon. React has made a great impression on me. It has helped me make better logical decisions rather than following old MVC and MVVM patters, separating the view completely.

Currently I'm working as a React developer with my friends at [Bits Beat](https://www.bitsbeat.com/ "Bits beat IT Solution"). We have a healthy team, and we take on challenges in the programming world with JS as our main tool.
